I miss biology so much this semester
Why didn't I take a course 7 or 20 class this semester?
I thought I was tipping my delivery drivers generously but I did some math and realized my tips were average
I've been so sarcastic about everything for such a long time that my whole life looks like a joke to me now
I'm rarely sure if what I think or what I say is actually serious or not
This is serious and it's bothering me
Am I just trying to sound funny
I just haven't found one
I just bombed my 18.06 midterm completely
Apparently I'm sad but I am also very grateful
I am grateful for experiencing the sadness of screwing up on things I worked really hard for so that I can better relate when the people around me feel the same way
I want one too
I think I'm in an abusive relationship but I love him too much to leave him
I'm tired of loving things that don't love me back
It kills me that my gf is so unsure of herself
I just wish people tried more things
Got back a horrible score on an exam
I'm actually just really irritated with MIT culture
how do I choose a major when I'm just vaguely incompetent at everything I do
I did everything for you and now you don't even want to talk to me
I find the sheer disrespect of some of the people in my major for HASS classes to be quite galling
I really need to stop thinking
WHY AM I SUCH A USELESS IDIOT
Am I acting in front of everyone else or do I just not like myself?
Is it wrong to think of a relationship as a repeated hookup?
Don't know if I'll ever have the courage to truely love someone
I'm so confused about everything in my life right now
But I hate how many idiots there are in this school who are content because they were admitted and think it's a sign of intelligence
I still need to talk to my boyfriend about whether or not our relationship is exclusive I keep waiting for the appropriate time to come but it always seems like an awkward thing to bring up in any situation
I'm so frustrated by my coursework that it makes me feel sick and so disinterested in it that I can't focus on it for longer than half an hour at a time
I'm so sick of my fake friends but I don't think I'm social enough to make any new ones
I'm insecure but I'm extremely good at masking it
Is it bad if I'm crushing on a boy who's already taken?
I miss being in a relationship and I wish my boyfriend fought for me more
I hope his time here at MIT opens his eyes up a bit and helps him become a more thoughtful person
Course 6 is legit the most cancerous major
The only reason I haven't broken up with my girlfriend is that she told me she would kill herself if it happened
My proudest achievement is sitting at the cool kids table at the mental hospital
I don't mean I'm depressed
I just havent found happiness
I have no reason to stop and smell the roses
I almost sacrificed my whole life to science and that kinda shit
The hottest and smartest guys are definitely course 10 but why are they all in long-distance relationships?
I wanna get hit by a car like just fucking do it please
I hate the fucking psets and I walk in front of cars every morning hoping that today will be the day
I'm a 2020 and feel like I should make new friends but also don't want to leave my current living group behind
If MIT really cared about student well-being they would install nap pods all over campus
I'm so fucking glad that I have broken up with my girlfriend
All I really want is for my family to be proud of me
They encourage and support everything I do
Whenever they say they are proud of me and that I'm doing great things I can't help but feel that they are just lying to me and that they are only saying these things because I am their only child and they are pretty much stuck with me
I really just want to truly feel that they are proud of me and that they feel the sacrifices they made to get me here were worth it
I don't mean to brag but I took a shower yesterday
How do you not feel jealous when ur significant other starts hanging out a ton with another person of the opposite gender?
It's been about a week since I broke it off with my ex and each day my heart aches just a little more
I just want to have sex like all the time
Is that too much to ask for?
I got a last minute internship by hooking up with a random person in a bar in Boston
My parents never read to me growing up so my boyfriend has taken the role of reading me a bedtime story every night
When I meet people I'm interested in dating them largely for their personality
It's basically the whole focus for me so I have a lot of trouble flirting or even figuring out how to let the other person know that they're attractive to me
I think it's a big part of getting involved in a relationship to let the other person know once in a while but I don't know how to do it esp at the beginning
I just want a straight guy that likes getting rimmed
I wonder how my friend's girlfriend would feel if she knew how close he was to other girls
Like this if you've got some personal things you'd like to talk to someone experienced about
AirPods make you look dumb
Seeing the girl you love dating one of your best friend is straight up torture
And don't even get me started on PDAs I think I may vomit
Not gonna lie I really like girls with deep voices
I don't understand why girls complain so much about faking orgasms
Like I'm pretty sure most men sincerely want to help you orgasm
They aren't holding out on you or something
Why don't you just tell them what to do or what you like?
I'm on the brink of failing a couple classes and I'm sure it's because I don't care
I get a 40% on a midterm handed back to me and instead of being slammed by depression or just some motivation to do better
I have an insanely strong work ethic when it comes to stuff I really like doing which does include my other classes but when it comes to these ones there's no urge to do it
I'm happy when I know it probably isn't the best time to be content
Something's up and I don't know what
Maybe I just genuinely dislike these classes and I need to change my major
I definitely need to figure out a way to get on track but without some sort of motivation or borderline depression
I've been a strong independent and very happy single woman my whole life
For the first time a guy is attracted to me and i dont know how to deal with this
All relationships are based on openness and honesty but sometimes it's just easier to lie
I'm a socially awkward international student who really wants casual sex
Any girls willing to take my virginity?
Im a freshmen guy and have hooked up with about 8 girls since I came here
Is it normal that the material on the exam is neither covered in the lecture nor found on the internet?
I've been so exhausted and overworked this semester that I've started accidentally flaking on really important things
I try to clear out my schedule 30 minutes before things like interviews
I've already overslept on 2 UROP interviews which I feel the worst about because I feel like I've wasted these people's time
I just want someone to sing me to sleep every night
Why do professors here think undergrads are not worth their time?
I deserve an academy award for every orgasm I have faked on this campus
I think I fell in love with you for a second there
THE NUMBER of times I have genuinely contemplated blowing my savings on a cheap pickup truck and driving down to south carolina to live out my days as a waitress in a small town is alarming
You know that moment when you bomb a test and literally dont care at all?
I hate walking by people to and from the kitchen because I feel like they're always judging what I eat
The worst part about senior year is falling for someone but not having the time to tell them your true feelings
MIT blue-balled me harder than my girlfriend does with that school closing email
I got full points on a pset for a proof I pulled out the ass
I can't believe this girl is friends with me she's so cool and amazing and I feel blessed that she even wants to hang out with me
I dated people in senior year bc I was bored
I thought our relationship was something meaningful and special to the both of us
I loved you with everything I had
Every scrap of free time I spent with you to the detriment of my sleep and work because I thought you were worth it
But I gave too much and you hurt me over and over again
You crushed my heart by making me believe in something that wasn't there
And I can't help but wonder why
I just want someone to cuddle me for a few minutes before I return to studying to death
I had no idea how big of an ass my ex is until I started dating my current bf
I went from being with a selfish rude and narcissistic guy to being with a guy who adores me and would do anything to make me happy and who I can see myself spending the rest of my life with
MIT has just not been too hard for me
If I could succeed anywhere why did I even come here?
I'd be happier with higher GPA and self-esteem elsewhere
I have something to get off my chest
I am sexually frustrated
Senior dating another senior here potentially facing the prospect of going long-distance after graduation and I don't know what to feel or think or prioritize?
How do I know if a LDR is right for us or worth all the hassle it's made out to be?
A lot of my friends have graduated and are doing real world stuff
I know it's bound to happen because that's just how life works but it's sad to see everyone scatter across different locations
Communication falls off and there aren't a lot of common things to talk about anymore because you don't see them all the time on campus
I just wish there was an easy way to initiate conversations without them seeming so sudden or out of place
Psetting with you guys reminds me how fun school is, that staying up late and watching YouTube videos is good times
There's a lesson to learn by spending time with frosh but it's harder to get when you live off-campus
I'm fucking someone I don't even like just because his place is far enough from the bubble that it finally allows me to stop agonizing about work and feel normal for a bit
It annoys the shit out of me probably more than it should
I think I have a psychological problem that only she can help with
You ever get hit with a smell and it brings you back so vividly to a specific moment like years ago?
I haven't told any of my friends about the new study space on the third floor of the stud because it's the only quiet place I can work in without sweating and I don't want it getting too crowded
Everyone else seems to be just fine so I feel like I have no one else to cry to but my dean
I create imaginary people and have a full conversation with them on a regular basis
Not sure why MIT people are so proud when basically MIT is a shitty version of Stanford
Before I dated my boyfriend I rarely responded to his texts because I was so busy and I told him that
However his texts were usually hilarious and gave me a good laugh whenever I was in need of one
He also provided me with information and guidance since we both want to enter medical school
This was when I started liking him because I felt like he was always there for me even though we were in different states at the time
I feel like at some point these feelings are supposed to fade
But we've been dating for so long now and I love you even more than I did at the start
It takes a certain kind of person to ruin a group like that
I feel like MIT doesn't really prepare people for what the real world is like at all
You're just kept in a box and expected to work day in and day out
People just need some time to breathe and be human
Why the FUCK do we always need these specific ass math tricks to solve seemingly simple pset problems?
I wish I could sleep all day or eat whole bag of potato chip all night doing nothing
MIT has been an incredible experience for me
It has challenged me to become a more resilient problem solver and to define a sense of self independent of what others think of me
I'm pretty sure my significant other is going to break up with me because I'm depressed
I used to be very social but I guess no one wants to be around me now that I'm not always happy
I miss being in a relationship
I loved with all my heart at the time
If you're dating someone right now don't take them for granted
Let them know how cute they are and how much you admire them and believe in their ambitions
