    <h1>The Word Made Digital Showcase</h1>
    <p>  A showcase of my project work for the class CMS.609: The Word Made Digital, at MIT<p>
    <p>  By: Matt Farejowicz</p>
    <br/>
    <div class="desc">
      Program 1: <a href="./wordsnake/index.html">work, work, work</a>
      <p>Prompt: Write a very simple text generator that is nevertheless interesting ...
        it should do something new with language and computation.</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div class="desc">
      Program 2: <a href="./down-the-staircase/down-the-staircase.py">Down the Staircase</a> (Link will download .py to your computer)
      <p>Prompt: Create your own tiny computer-generated booklet
        using (1) a short, self-contained Python program of no more than 66 lines
        (80 characters/line); (2) a single printed sheet, US letter size, which
        can be printed single-sided or double-sided.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="desc">
      Program 3: <a href="./botbook/index.html">BotBook</a>
      <p>Prompt: The implementation of an originally non-digital writing procedure,
        of writing within a set pre-digital form, or of writing using a constraint,
        such as an Oulipian constraint. You should select an existing formal writing
        technique of some sort and implement it. You can make a system that is general
        (works on any source text) or not.</p>

    <div class="desc">
      Program 4: <a href="./expression/expression.py">Expression</a> (Link will download .py to your computer)
      <p>Prompt: Produce an interactive prototype that engages language and
        computation. It may be a game, may be a multimedia production,
        may be networked, etc. but in any case should be as simple as possible
        for its purpose. It should be interactive ... and capable of being shown
        in an interactive demo.</p>
